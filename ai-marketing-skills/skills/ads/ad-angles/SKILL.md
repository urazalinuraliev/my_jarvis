# Ad Angle Brainstorm

## Usage

Use when brainstorming ad ideas before launching a new campaign, generating headline variations for A/B testing, exploring new messaging angles for a stale campaign, or preparing creative briefs for ad production.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

Ask the user for:
1. **Product description** — what it does, key features, core benefit
2. **Target audience** — who they're targeting (role, industry, business type & stage)
3. **Platform** — where the ads will run (Reddit, LinkedIn, Meta, Google, X/Twitter, etc.). This affects dimensions, tone, and output fields.
4. **Competitor names** (optional) — for comparison-based angles
5. **Proof points** (optional) — metrics, testimonials, customer count, case studies
6. **Number of concepts** (optional) — default: 10
7. **Constraints** (optional) — brand tone, things to avoid, compliance requirements

If the user has multiple products, ask which product this campaign is for. Don't assume — different products have different audiences, price points, and angles.

### Step 1b: Diagnose Market Awareness & Sophistication

Before generating angles, diagnose where the target market sits on two axes. This determines which angle types will work and which will fail.

**Market Awareness (5 stages):**

| Stage | Prospect Knows | Headline Strategy | Angle Types That Work |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 — Most Aware | Product + desire + ready to buy | Name product + price/offer | Proof, Solution (direct) |
| 2 — Product Aware | Product exists, not yet convinced | Reinforce desire, show proof, new mechanism | Proof, Solution, Comparison |
| 3 — Solution Aware | Wants the outcome, doesn't know your product | Name the desire/outcome first, then introduce product | Solution (benefit), Curiosity |
| 4 — Problem Aware | Feels the pain, doesn't know solutions exist | Name the pain, dramatize it, present product as answer | Problem, Curiosity |
| 5 — Unaware | Doesn't recognize the problem or won't admit it | Identification headline — echo an emotion or attitude, not a product claim | Curiosity (identification) |

**Market Sophistication (5 stages):**

| Stage | Market State | Strategy |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 — First in market | No competitors have made this claim | State the claim directly and boldly |
| 2 — Competition appeared | Same claims exist | Enlarge the claim — go bigger, bolder |
| 3 — Claims worn out | Neither claim nor size works | Introduce a new mechanism — a new WAY to get the result |
| 4 — Mechanisms copied | Competitors adopted the mechanism | Feature and elaborate the mechanism, or find a superior one |
| 5 — Market exhausted | Nothing is believed | Shift to pure identification — no promises, project character |

Flag the awareness and sophistication stages in the output. If the market is at Awareness Stage 5 / Sophistication Stage 5, don't generate direct benefit headlines — they won't work. Shift to curiosity and identification angles.

### Step 1c: Run the Emotion Audit

Before writing headlines, identify the emotional drivers behind the purchase.

**Emotion Audit template:**
```
Nobody buys [YOUR PRODUCT] for [FUNCTIONAL REASON].
They buy it to feel [EMOTION 1], [EMOTION 2], and [EMOTION 3].
```

Map the emotional cluster (2-3 emotions) for the target market:
- **Functional need:** What specific task does the product accomplish?
- **Social need:** Who do they need to impress? What status does it signal?
- **Emotional need:** How do they want to feel after using it?

### Step 2: Map Available Angles

Work through each of the 5 angle types and identify which ones are available based on the product and market:

#### Angle 1: Problem (Pain-Focused)
Lead with a pain the target market is facing. Make the reader feel the problem viscerally before mentioning a solution.

Generate problem angles by asking:
- What frustrates this person about their current approach?
- What are they wasting time/money on?
- What's broken, slow, or painful in their workflow?
- What keeps them up at night related to this problem?

#### Angle 2: Solution (Benefit-Focused or Process-Focused)
Lead with an outcome (**benefit-focused**), or show the method/system (**process-focused**).

Generate solution angles by asking:
- What does their life look like after using this product? (benefit)
- What specific outcome or metric improves? (benefit)
- What's the step-by-step process that makes this work? (process)

#### Angle 3: Comparison
Position against alternatives (competitors, old way, status quo).

Generate comparison angles by asking:
- What are they using today? (spreadsheets, competitor X, manual process)
- What's wrong with the current alternative?
- What's the old way vs. new way?

#### Angle 4: Proof (Results-Focused)
Lead with credibility, results, or social proof.

Generate proof angles by asking:
- What results have customers achieved?
- How many customers/users do you have?
- Any notable logos, testimonials, or case studies?

#### Angle 5: Curiosity
Lead with intrigue, insight, or a counterintuitive take.

Generate curiosity angles by asking:
- What's a counterintuitive truth about this space?
- What's a mistake most people in this market make?
- What's a surprising insight from your data or experience?

**For each angle type, list 3-5 specific angles available based on the product and market.**

### Step 3: Select Formats

For each angle, pick the most effective format:

| Format | Structure | Best paired with |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Direct** | Straightforward value statement | Solution, Proof |
| **Before/After** | Show transformation | Problem, Solution |
| **Us vs Them** | Side-by-side comparison | Comparison |
| **Testimonial** | Customer quote or review | Proof |
| **Question** | Lead with a question they ask themselves | Problem, Curiosity |
| **Listicle** | Multiple benefits as a list | Solution |

### Step 4: Assign Styles

For each concept, recommend a visual style:

| Style | Look & feel | Best for |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Branded** | Professional, matches brand design system | Solution, Proof — builds credibility |
| **Product image** | Screenshot of UI, dashboard, output | Solution, Direct — makes product feel real |
| **Meme** | Popular meme template, captioned images | Problem, Curiosity, Comparison — stops the scroll |
| **Ugly** | Text-heavy, high-contrast colors, deliberately unpolished. Square format. | Problem, Question, Solution — stands out in polished feeds |
| **Native** | Looks like an organic social post, casual | Proof (testimonial), Curiosity — reduces ad resistance |

### Step 5: Generate Concepts

Combine angles + formats + styles into concrete ad concepts. For each concept, produce:

1. **Concept name** — Short label (e.g., "Pain: Spreadsheet Hell")
2. **Angle type** — Problem / Solution / Comparison / Proof / Curiosity
3. **Format** — Direct / Before-After / Us vs Them / Testimonial / Question / Listicle
4. **Style** — Branded / Product image / Meme / Ugly / Native
5. **Headline** — The actual ad headline text (goes on the image creative)
6. **Ad copy** — The text that accompanies the image (platform-dependent: post text for Reddit/LinkedIn, primary text for Meta, etc.)
7. **CTA** — Call-to-action button text
8. **Image suggestion** — What screenshot or visual to use
9. **Landing page angle** — How the landing page should match this ad's promise

Generate the requested number of concepts (default: 10), ensuring:
- At least 2 different angle types are represented
- At least 2 different styles are represented
- Headlines use the target market's language, not marketing jargon
- Each headline could stand alone and make someone curious enough to click

### Step 6: Prioritize for Testing

Recommend which 3 concepts to test first based on:
1. **Angle diversity** — Don't test 3 problem angles. Test problem + solution + curiosity.
2. **Ease of production** — Simpler creatives first (branded/product image over meme)
3. **Specificity** — More specific headlines tend to outperform generic ones
4. **Risk level** — Start with safer concepts, add edgier ones in round 2

### Step 7: Present and Confirm

**This step is mandatory. Do not skip it.**

Present the full concept table to the user showing all generated concepts with their angle, format, style, and headline. Include the recommended test batch but make it clear these are suggestions.

Ask the user:
1. Which concepts do you want to move forward with?
2. Do you want to change any headlines, styles, or angles?

**Testing approach:** Run all 3 in the same ad group targeting the same audience. Compare CTR and conversion rate.
```

## Rules

- Headlines should be written in the target market's language, not yours. If plumbers say "jobs" not "projects," your headline says "jobs."
- Specificity beats cleverness. "Save 12 hours/week on reporting" beats "Work smarter, not harder."
- Don't force all 5 angle types if you don't have the raw material. No proof points? Skip proof. No competitor to compare against? Skip comparison. Weak angles produce weak ads.
- Each concept should be testable independently. Don't create concepts that depend on each other.
- Ad copy should complement the headline, not repeat it. Use it to add context or intrigue.
- The cookie-cutter template (headline + product image + clean background) is the fastest way to test many angles with minimal production overhead.
