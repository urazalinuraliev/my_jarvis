# Conversion Audit

## Usage

Use when auditing a landing page, sales page, or product page before launch, diagnosing why a page gets traffic but doesn't convert, reviewing ad landing pages before spending on paid media, or checking a page against direct response best practices.

## Framework Reference

This audit synthesises two complementary direct-response principles:

**Narrative arc (pain → dream → fix)** — A landing page that sells follows a story, not a feature list.

```
Pain → Sandwich → Dream → Sandwich → Fix → Sandwich → CTA (wrapped in dream)
```

Each section transitions via "sandwiches" — brief passages that bounce between hope and reality to create tension. The page stars the **customer**, not the product.

**Conversion mechanics (clarity → desire → credibility → action)** — Every landing page must achieve clarity (hero divider), intensify desire (fascinations / value teasing), earn credibility (confidence signals + testimonial walls), and compel immediate action (urgency + friction removal).

Key vocabulary:
- **Crispy** = specific, concrete, vivid copy drawn from customer research (vs. "soggy" vague platitudes)
- **Obliteration** = each dream word directly cancels a specific pain word (fear → confidence, streaky → flawless)
- **Sandwich** = a transition between sections that steps forward and back to create drama
- **Active frame** = copy shifts from passive/fearful to active/imperative as it moves toward the CTA
- **Slippery slide** = every element's job is to compel reading the next element
- **50ms trust** = visitors decide in 50 milliseconds whether they trust a page — before reading a word
- **LISH** = Length Implies Strength Heuristic — a wall of proof signals substance

## Process

### Step 1: Fetch & Parse

Fetch the URL provided by the user. Extract:
- Full rendered page content (text, headings, images, CTAs)
- Page structure and visual flow (section order, above-fold content)
- All CTAs (buttons, forms, links) — text, placement, and frequency
- Social proof elements (testimonials, logos, stats, reviews)
- Any pricing or offer information visible on the page

If the user provides context about the offer (product, audience, price point), note it for evaluation.

### Step 2: Customer Focus & Framing (8 checks)

The #1 failing of pages that don't convert.

1. **Customer is the star** — The page talks to and about the customer, not about the product
2. **Opens with the customer's world** — First paragraph narrates the customer's situation, not the product's features
3. **Uses customer language** — Words and phrases the target audience actually uses
4. **Single audience focus** — Page speaks to one specific audience
5. **Problem is named before product** — Pain established before any product mention
6. **No premature product reveal** — Product name isn't the headline
7. **Emotional core identified** — Page addresses emotional pain, not just functional problems
8. **Frame is set and maintained** — Headline sets a specific frame and the rest stays within it

### Step 3: Narrative Arc — Pain → Dream → Fix (10 checks)

1. **Pain section exists** — Distinct section naming specific pain points with crispy details
2. **Dream section exists** — Vivid picture of life with the pain obliterated
3. **Fix section exists** — How the product delivers the dream with sub-fixes mapping to specific pains
4. **Pain → Dream → Fix order** — Sections appear in correct narrative sequence
5. **Obliteration pattern present** — Dream language directly cancels specific pain language
6. **Sandwiches create transitions** — Transitional passages step forward and back between sections
7. **Narrative builds to the CTA** — CTA comes after the narrative builds to it
8. **Fix is earned, not assumed** — Product reveal held until reader is emotionally invested
9. **Active frame progression** — Copy shifts from passive/fearful to active/imperative by the CTA
10. **Not a feature list** — Page follows a narrative arc, not bullet-point features

### Step 3b: SaaS Page Section Flow (B2B SaaS only)

If the page appears to be B2B SaaS, verify these sections exist in roughly this order:

| # | Section | What to check |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Hero | Result + objection-elimination headline, dual CTAs |
| 2 | Social proof bar | Customer logos immediately below hero |
| 3 | Problem section | Hook headline, pain in ~25 words |
| 4 | Testimonial | Outcomes-focused pull quote |
| 5 | Solution section | Outcomes headline, how-it-works |
| 6 | Features section | 3 feature blocks framed as benefits |
| 7 | Support section | "Everything you need" checklist |
| 8 | Second testimonial | Different customer, different benefit |
| 9 | Closing CTA | "More [outcome]." with dual CTAs |

Skip this check entirely for non-SaaS pages.

### Step 4: Crispy Copy (8 checks)

1. **Specific claims over vague ones** — Numbers, timeframes, concrete details
2. **Pain details are crispy** — Recognizable details that make the reader say "how did they know?"
3. **Dream details are crispy** — Vivid, specific picture including sensory and temporal details
4. **Fix details are crispy** — Specific sub-fixes, not just "our product solves this"
5. **Clear, not clever** — Direct and transparent, no wordplay or puns
6. **No buzzword soup** — Free of "leverage," "synergy," "best-in-class," "seamless," "robust"
7. **Copy is scannable** — Short paragraphs, subheadings, bold text
8. **Appropriate copy length** — Matches audience awareness level and offer complexity

### Step 4b: Emotional Resonance Check (3 checks)

1. **Emotion Audit applied** — "Nobody buys [PRODUCT] for [FUNCTION]. They buy it to feel [EMOTIONS]." Does the copy activate these emotions?
2. **Identity purchase recognized** — Does the page show the buyer the version of themselves they become?
3. **Story over specs** — Does the page lead with narrative and aspiration?

### Step 5: Design & Readability (8 checks)

1. **Single column layout** — No sidebars or competing columns
2. **Left-aligned body text** — Not centered body copy
3. **Comfortable line width** — ~70-80 characters per line
4. **No content jiggle** — Content doesn't alternate text-left/image-right
5. **Above-fold earns the scroll** — First screen creates enough interest to scroll
6. **Every visual element serves the pitch** — No generic stock photos or decorative clutter
7. **50ms visual trust** — Page looks professional and trustworthy at a glance
8. **Whitespace and breathing room** — Sections have adequate spacing

### Step 6: CTA & Commitment Architecture (8 checks)

1. **CTA copy is outcome-focused** — "Start my free trial" not "Submit"
2. **Reason to act now** — Genuine, specific reason to convert today
3. **CTA visually unique** — Button colour not shared with non-clickable elements
4. **CTA looks like a button** — Obviously clickable
5. **CTA placement follows narrative** — Primary CTA appears after narrative builds to it
6. **Max 2 CTA types** — Primary conversion + lower commitment at most
7. **CTA hierarchy matches buying behaviour** — Matches typical visitor journey
8. **Minimal form friction** — Only asks for what's absolutely necessary

### Step 7: Proof & Objection Handling (8 checks)

1. **Testimonials cite specific results** — Specific outcomes and numbers
2. **Testimonials have attribution** — Real names, photos, titles
3. **Social proof has depth and volume** — Multiple forms, not just a single testimonial
4. **Proof placement is layered** — Confidence signals early, detailed proof throughout
5. **Objections addressed directly** — Real objections with honest responses
6. **Risk reversal present** — Guarantee, free trial, or money-back policy
7. **Proof is proportional to the ask** — Stronger proof for higher-commitment offers
8. **No fake urgency** — Any urgency signals are genuine

## Priority Fixes

[Top 5 failed criteria ranked by conversion impact. For each:]

1. **[Failed criterion]** — [Why it kills conversions + specific rewrite/fix with actual suggested copy where possible]
2. ...
```

## Rules

- Be objective. If borderline, lean toward FAIL — mediocre doesn't convert.
- Be specific in fixes — suggest actual headline rewrites, actual CTA copy, actual testimonial placement. "Improve the headline" is not useful. "Rewrite headline to: '[suggested text]'" is.
- Priority fixes should weight: customer focus > narrative arc > CTA mechanics > copy > proof > design. If the page doesn't talk to the customer or follow a narrative, nothing else matters.
- If user provides offer context (product, audience, price), use it to evaluate message-market fit.
- If user specifies a focus area, still run all checks but only expand detail on the requested section.
- Stop and ask if the page is behind a login wall or if it appears to be a homepage rather than a dedicated landing page.
- Never score based on aesthetic preference — focus on conversion principles.
- Never assume the target audience — if unclear, note it as a gap.
- Flag if the page has no clear single CTA, talks entirely about the product and never the customer, or appears to receive paid traffic with no tracking pixels.
