## How to Use

**Claude Code plugin users:** Skills are auto-discovered — just ask Claude to run any skill by name.

**Other tools:** When a user asks to run an audit (or any skill), read the corresponding `SKILL.md` file and follow its instructions exactly. Pass the user's input (e.g. a URL) as the argument.

## Conventions

- Skills live in `skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- The frontmatter `name` must match the kebab-case directory name.
- Descriptions should identify both the capability and when to use it.
- Each skill defines its own process, output format, evidence handling, and quality rules.
- Never include client data, confidential material, credentials, or proprietary orchestration.
- Do not make untested compatibility, performance, or outcome claims.
- Keep `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` synchronized with user-visible changes.
- Install `requirements-dev.txt` and run `scripts/validate.sh` before submitting changes; it uses the official `skills-ref` validator plus repository-specific checks.

## Integrations

Some skills use MCP servers. See `integrations/` for setup guides.
