    alerts. Internal-channel rows and the `nudge_scan` heartbeat are excluded —
    they have no user-visible side effect, so they would inflate the
    "heartbeat" without representing anything the user did or saw.

    Buckets by calendar day (UTC) via `substr(...,1,10)`. Decisions/advice
    bucket by their `timestamp` (when they happened); fired actions bucket by
    `run_at` (when they fired), NOT `created_at` (when they were queued) — a
    cadence queued the night before should count on the day it actually fires,
    so the "Beats today" tile stays truthful. (This is the schema-light version
    of the fix `_build_activity` defers: there is no `done_at` column, but for a
    done action `run_at` is the closest persisted proxy for fire time.)
    Workflow runs bucket by `updated_at` (completion), initiatives by
    `created_at`, resolved decisions by `resolved_at`, alerts by `created_at`.
