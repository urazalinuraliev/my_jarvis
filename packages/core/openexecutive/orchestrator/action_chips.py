"""Classify side-effecting Executive tool calls and produce inline action chips.

Used by the agent loop to emit `action_taken` SSE events whenever the
Executive fires a tool that takes a real-world action — sending a DM,
scheduling a follow-up, opening a workflow, mutating the people roster,
flagging an alert. The UI renders the resulting chips below the assistant's
prose so the user can see *what happened* without it being buried in
narrative.

Read-only tools (`consult_specialist`, `lookup_person`, `list_people`,
`search_skills`, `load_skill`, `search_tools`, `web_search`,
`ask_about_person`, `list_workflows`) deliberately produce no chip — only
actions visible outside the chat get surfaced.
