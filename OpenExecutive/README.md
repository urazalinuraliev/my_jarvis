An AI system that acts as your company's virtual executive team — a senior advisor with Harvard MBA-level knowledge, customized for your specific business.

## Demo

[![Open Executive demo video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/O_g97xxVTMk/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/O_g97xxVTMk)

A walkthrough of Open Executive in action — [watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/O_g97xxVTMk).

## What It Does

Developed by [sentelabs.ai](https://sentelabs.ai) Open Executive provides a single coherent executive voice backed by eight specialist AI agents:

- **Chief Strategy Officer** — competitive analysis, M&A, market positioning, OKRs
- **Chief Financial Officer** — financial modeling, fundraising, unit economics, cash flow
- **Chief HR/People Officer** — hiring, compensation, performance, culture
- **General Counsel** — contracts, IP, employment law basics, compliance
- **Chief Operating Officer** — process design, vendor management, operational scaling
- **Chief Marketing Officer** — GTM strategy, brand, communications, PR
- **Chief Product Officer** — roadmap, prioritization, product strategy
- **Board Communications Director** — board decks, investor relations, governance

All responses come from one consistent executive voice. The internal agent architecture is never exposed to the user. Beyond Q&A, the system maintains episodic memory of past decisions and initiatives across sessions, and a built-in scheduler can proactively surface follow-ups and time-sensitive actions.

## Architecture

```
User message
    ↓
Executive Orchestrator (claude-sonnet-5)
    ↓ tool use → parallel specialist calls
CSO / CFO / CHRO / GC / COO / CMO / CPO / Board
    ↓ each specialist retrieves relevant context from ChromaDB
Built-in MBA knowledge + Your company documents
    ↓
Synthesized executive response
```

**Knowledge** — Two retrieval layers per specialist call: (1) built-in MBA-level Markdown (`knowledge/builtin/`, git-tracked) seeded into ChromaDB at startup, and (2) your uploaded company documents chunked and stored in a separate `company_docs` collection. RAG context is injected into the user turn, never the cached system prompt.

**Episodic memory** — After every response, a background `claude-haiku-4-5` pass extracts key decisions, initiatives, and advice into SQLite. The next session opens with a `<past_decisions>` block so the Executive remembers what it recommended last month.

**Scheduler** — A built-in job runner claims due actions via `UPDATE … RETURNING` to prevent double-firing. The API must run as a single instance; do not horizontally scale it without gating the scheduler first.

**Prompt caching** — The system prompt is structured so the Executive persona, company profile, and knowledge index are cached separately (up to 85% cache hit rate after the first few turns). No dynamic content ever goes in a cached block.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full design.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SenteLabsAI/OpenExecutive.git
cd OpenExecutive

# Set your Anthropic API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# For the web UI's Google sign-in, also fill in the AUTH_* block
# (see docs/auth.md for the Google Cloud Console steps).

# Start everything
make dev
```

All configuration lives in that repo-root `.env` — `make dev` and `make docker`
both load it for the API *and* the UI (Auth.js needs `AUTH_SECRET` /
`AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` / `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` at runtime). A
`packages/ui/.env.local` is also read for UI-only keys, but for keys present
in both files the root `.env` takes precedence.

Open http://localhost:3000 to start chatting with your executive. The API runs on port 8000 and the UI on 3000.

> **First run:** requires Python 3.11+ and Node 22+. The initial `uv sync` pulls heavy
> ML dependencies (ChromaDB + sentence-transformers/PyTorch), and the first boot
> downloads a small embedding model (~90 MB) to build the local vector index — so the
> first `make dev` takes a few minutes before the app is ready. Subsequent starts are fast.

**For contributors not using `make`:**

```bash
cd packages/core
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn openexecutive.api.main:app --reload --port 8000

# In a second terminal
cd packages/ui && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Run the Discord Bot

1. Create a Discord application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Enable the **Message Content** privileged intent (Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents)
3. Invite the bot with `bot` + `applications.commands` scopes
4. Set env vars in `.env`: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_APP_ID`, `DISCORD_GUILD_IDS`
5. Run the API normally — the bot starts as part of the FastAPI lifespan when `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is set:

```bash
make dev
```

The bot is embedded in the API process (alongside the email poller, scheduler, and resumer) so it shares the same SQLite database and ChromaDB vector store under `/data` in production. Skip the token to disable.

For iterating on bot-only code without restarting the API, `make discord` runs the bot as a standalone process against the same local DB.

Users can DM the bot, `@mention` it in a channel (replies in a thread), or use `/ask` and `/today` slash commands. Slash commands sync to `DISCORD_GUILD_IDS` instantly on startup; leave blank for global registration (up to 1-hour propagation delay).

### Deploying to production

Just set the secrets on the existing API app — no new Fly app required:

```bash
flyctl secrets set -a openexec-api-dev \
  DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=... \
  DISCORD_APP_ID=... \
  DISCORD_GUILD_IDS=...
```

Discord user access is managed via the /people UI — add a Person row with `discord_user_id` set.

The machine restarts and the bot starts on the next lifespan boot. To disable in prod: `flyctl secrets unset -a openexec-api-dev DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`.

## Onboarding Your Company

The first time you visit the app, you'll be guided through a wizard to set up your company profile:
- Company basics (name, industry, stage, team size)
- Business model and revenue
- Competitive landscape
- Strategic priorities
- Culture and values
- Optional: financial position, document upload

After onboarding, the Executive will reference your specific company context in every response.

## Interfaces

| Interface | How to Use |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Web UI** | `http://localhost:3000` |
| **Slack** | Mention `@OpenExecutive` or DM the app |
| **Email** | CC or email the configured address (IMAP/SMTP poller) |
| **Telegram** | Message the configured bot |
| **Google Chat** | Mention the app in a space |
| **Discord** | DM the bot, `@mention` it in a channel, or use `/ask` / `/today` slash commands |
| **CLI** | `openexecutive chat` |

## Document Upload

Upload your pitch deck, financial model, strategy docs, or any company documents via the web UI or API. The Executive will reference them when relevant.

```bash
# Via CLI
openexecutive upload deck.pdf model.xlsx strategy.md

# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents \
  -F "file=@deck.pdf" \
  -F "domain=strategy"
```

## Deployment (Fly.io)

Two environments, each a separate set of Fly apps, driven by branch:

| Environment | Trigger | Workflow | Apps |
|---|---|---|---|
| **dev** | push/merge to `main` (continuous) | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | `openexec-api-dev`, `openexec-ui-dev` |
| **qa** | push/merge to `qa` (deliberate promotion) | `.github/workflows/deploy-qa.yml` | `openexec-api-qa`, `openexec-ui-qa` |

Both workflows use `dorny/paths-filter` to deploy only the changed app (API, UI, or both). QA is a stable twin of dev — same image and runtime, only the app name differs (`fly.api.qa.toml` / `fly.ui.qa.toml`) — so it lags `main` and stays vetted. An optional Honcho memory app (`fly.honcho.toml`) deploys independently.

### Topology

| App | Purpose | State |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `openexec-api-{dev,qa}` | FastAPI + scheduler | Persistent volume `executive_data` at `/data` |
| `openexec-ui-{dev,qa}` | Next.js 15 | Stateless |
| `openexec-honcho-dev` | Honcho per-person memory (optional) | Postgres-backed |

> **⚠️ Single-instance only**: The scheduler claims rows via `UPDATE … RETURNING`. Running two API machines would double-fire scheduled actions. `max_machines_running = 1` is set in `fly.api.toml` / `fly.api.qa.toml` — do not override it.

### Required GitHub Actions secrets

Deploys authenticate with per-app Fly deploy tokens stored as repo (or org) Actions secrets. Generate each with `flyctl tokens create deploy -a <app> -x 999999h`:

| Secret | App | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `FLY_API_TOKEN_API` | `openexec-api-dev` | dev |
| `FLY_API_TOKEN_UI` | `openexec-ui-dev` | dev |
| `FLY_API_TOKEN_HONCHO` | `openexec-honcho-dev` | dev (honcho job) |
| `FLY_API_TOKEN_API_QA` | `openexec-api-qa` | qa |
| `FLY_API_TOKEN_UI_QA` | `openexec-ui-qa` | qa |

Per-app runtime secrets (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET`, the `AUTH_*` set, integration tokens) are set directly on each Fly app — see `scripts/fly-secrets.sh.example`.

### One-time bootstrap (dev)

```bash
# 1. Create apps and volume
flyctl apps create openexec-api-dev
flyctl apps create openexec-ui-dev
flyctl volumes create executive_data --region iad --size 1 -a openexec-api-dev

# 2. Set the required secret
flyctl secrets set -a openexec-api-dev ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# 3. Create deploy tokens and add as GitHub secrets FLY_API_TOKEN_API and FLY_API_TOKEN_UI
flyctl tokens create deploy -a openexec-api-dev -x 999999h
flyctl tokens create deploy -a openexec-ui-dev  -x 999999h

# 4. First deploy
gh workflow run "Deploy (dev)" -f target=both
```

QA bootstraps the same way against the `-qa` app names (push to the `qa` branch, or `gh workflow run "Deploy (qa)"`). See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the full runbook (operations, rollback, common failure modes, why `.flycast` isn't used).

### Access control

The deployed UI is gated behind Google sign-in with an email allow-list, and the public API is protected by a shared-secret header between the UI proxy and the FastAPI backend. See [docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md) for the full setup (Google Cloud Console steps, required Fly secrets, adding/removing users, rotating secrets, and a debugging table).

## Configuration

All settings via environment variables. Minimum required: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` —
*unless* you configure a local or OpenRouter backend instead (see [Running on

> ¹ `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is required only when you serve Claude models directly.
> It can be omitted entirely if you run on local models (`LOCAL_MODELS_ENABLED`)
> or route through OpenRouter (`OPENROUTER_ENABLED`).

> ² The application default is on, but **[.env.example](.env.example) ships
> `ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=false`** so a fresh setup incurs no per-search charges —
> if the agents tell you they can't search the web or read the news, flip it
> to `true` in your `.env` and restart. Uses Anthropic's server-side
> `web_search` tool, so it applies to Claude models (local models can't use
> it). `WEB_SEARCH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` / `WEB_SEARCH_BLOCKED_DOMAINS` scope where
> it may look (set at most one).

## Running on Local Models

Open Executive can run against any **OpenAI-compatible** local server — Ollama,
LM Studio, vLLM, or llama.cpp — instead of (or alongside) the Anthropic API.
Local model slugs route to your server through the same provider abstraction the
hosted models use; no agent or orchestrator code changes.

```bash
# 1. Pull a capable, tool-use-friendly model (example: Ollama)
ollama pull llama3.3

# 2. In .env — point at the local server and list the slugs to expose
LOCAL_MODELS_ENABLED=true
LOCAL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1   # Ollama default
LOCAL_MODELS=llama3.3

# 3. (Optional) run with NO Anthropic key — make local the default everywhere
DEFAULT_MODEL=llama3.3
DEEP_REASONING_MODEL=llama3.3
ROUTING_MODEL=llama3.3
# ...and leave ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unset
```

The listed slugs appear in the **Council UI** model dropdown, so you can also run
a hybrid setup — keep the Executive on Claude while flipping individual
specialists to a local model per-agent.

**Caveats.** Server-side web search (`ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH`) and Anthropic prompt
caching / extended thinking have no local equivalent and are automatically
disabled for local models. Multi-agent routing leans heavily on tool use, so
pick a model that's strong at it (e.g. Llama 3.3 70B, Qwen2.5) — small models
may route poorly. `LOCAL_API_KEY` is only needed if your server (vLLM, or a
gateway) requires a bearer token; Ollama and LM Studio need none.

### Using a hosted OpenAI-compatible gateway

The `LOCAL_*` settings are not limited to localhost — the same recipe works with
any **hosted** OpenAI-compatible endpoint (an aggregator or inference gateway):

```bash
LOCAL_MODELS_ENABLED=true
LOCAL_BASE_URL=https://gateway.example.com/v1
LOCAL_API_KEY=your-gateway-key
LOCAL_MODELS=vendor/model-a,vendor/model-b
```

The listed slugs are sent to the gateway verbatim and appear in the Council UI
dropdown, exactly like local slugs. Gateways that speak OpenRouter's request
format and model namespace can alternatively be used through the OpenRouter
path (`OPENROUTER_ENABLED=true` + `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` +
`OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://gateway.example.com/v1`), which keeps that path's
Claude-name translation and feature handling.

The local-model caveats above apply to the `LOCAL_*` path unchanged, plus one
that matters more for hosted endpoints: everything the Executive processes —
company profile, documents, conversations — is sent to whichever endpoint you
configure here. Point these settings only at a provider you trust with that
data.

## Adding a New Specialist Agent

1. Create `packages/core/openexecutive/agents/your_agent.py` extending `BaseAgent`
2. Add a system prompt constant in `packages/core/openexecutive/prompts/domain_prompts.py`
3. Register in `packages/core/openexecutive/orchestrator/router.py` — add to `SPECIALIST_REGISTRY` and the `specialist` enum in `SPECIALIST_TOOLS`
4. Add domain alias to `DOMAIN_ALIASES` in `packages/core/openexecutive/knowledge/retriever.py`
5. Add knowledge docs to `knowledge/builtin/your_domain/`
6. Add at least 2 eval scenarios to `evals/scenarios/`
7. Submit a PR — CI requires all of the above

## Development

```bash
make dev          # Start FastAPI + Next.js
make test         # Run Python tests
make eval         # Run eval suite
make lint         # Run ruff + mypy
make docker       # Build and run Docker stack

# Unit tests only (no API calls required)
pytest packages/core/tests/unit/ -v
```

## Evaluation System

`evals/` contains 29 scenarios covering all 8 domains, scored by `claude-opus-4-7` as an LLM-as-judge. Each scenario defines a query, simulated company context, expected topics, required specialist routing, and a domain-specific rubric. Five scoring dimensions (persona coherence, domain accuracy, company context utilization, routing quality, actionability) are each rated 1–5. The CI gate requires ≥ 3.5/5 average; any dimension dropping > 10% vs `main` fails the PR.

## Privacy

Everything in `company/` is gitignored — the profile YAML, uploaded documents, and the ChromaDB vector store. None of this leaves your local machine (or your own Fly volume in cloud deployments) except as part of prompts sent to the Anthropic API. Anthropic does not train on API data.
