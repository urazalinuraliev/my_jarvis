# Launcher for the Google Workspace MCP server (workspace-mcp), run as a STDIO
# child of the API's MCP gateway (extensible-mcp). The Executive consumes this
# server's Gmail/Calendar/Drive tools through that gateway.
#
# It is co-located in the API image (not a separate service): the gateway spawns
# it on demand from /data/company/mcp_servers.json, which points `command` here.
# See docs/deployment.md → "Google Workspace (co-located in the API)".
#
# Two Google-auth modes, selected per install via GWORKSPACE_AUTH_MODE (an env
# var / Fly secret — no image rebuild to switch):
#
#   oauth            (default) Single-user OAuth. The exec account grants consent
#                    once; the refresh token persists under
#                    WORKSPACE_MCP_CREDENTIALS_DIR on the API's /data volume.
#   service_account  Domain-wide delegation. A Workspace service account
#                    impersonates USER_GOOGLE_EMAIL. No browser callback.
#
# These vars reach this script because the gateway forwards them to extensible-mcp
# (_FORWARDED_ENV_VARS in orchestrator/mcp_gateway.py) and the google_workspace
# entry's `env` block passes them on to this child.

# port the co-located API (uvicorn) binds. Left unset, that helper grabs 8000
# first and uvicorn dies with "address already in use", hanging the whole boot.
# Pin it to a free non-8000 port so the API keeps 8000. stdio transport itself
# uses no port; this only relocates the helper (whose bind is best-effort — token
# refresh uses the stored credential, not this server). Overridable if 8765 ever
# clashes with something else in the container.
