"""Verify the chat route runs retrieve, format_for_prompt, and the Honcho
prefetch concurrently — and that the resolved peer_memory_context is passed
through to the Executive so the inner stream_chat skips its own prefetch.

Background: production data showed Honcho's `low` prefetch averaging ~2.9s.
Running it serially before the model call paid the full latency every turn.
