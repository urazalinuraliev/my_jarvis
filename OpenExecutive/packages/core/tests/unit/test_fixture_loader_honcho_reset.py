"""``reset_all_state`` must trigger Honcho workspace deletion alongside the
local wipe, and must keep going if the Honcho call raises.

The reset endpoint presents itself as a factory reset; without the Honcho
hook, peer cards keyed by old Person.id values are orphaned in the hosted
service forever. The regression-protective test here is the second one:
even if the Honcho call blows up (network, permission, missing SDK), the
rest of the reset still completes.
