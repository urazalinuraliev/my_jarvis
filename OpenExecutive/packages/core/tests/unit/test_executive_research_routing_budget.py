"""Regression tests for the executive_research routing budget.

The bug: ``_MAX_ROUTING_TOOLS_PER_RUN`` counted EVERY successful tool
call, including ``lookup_person`` — the read-only tool the synthesis
prompt explicitly tells the Executive to call first to resolve a
recipient. The Executive looked up its department heads, exhausted the
budget on the lookups, and the loop terminated before a single DM was
sent: "looks up people but never routes."

The fix treats read-only context lookups (``_NON_ROUTING_TOOLS``) as
free: they are passed to ``execute_tool_calls`` as ``free_tools`` (never
refused, never decrement the budget) and excluded from the budget-
accounting counts via ``_routing_ok``.

Two levels:
  - ``execute_tool_calls`` mechanism (hermetic, no provider).
  - ``_executive_synthesis_loop`` end-to-end with a stubbed provider —
    reproduces the original 5-lookups-then-no-DM failure.
