"""Unit tests for the router's specialist → department memory wiring.

Verifies that ``route_parallel`` resolves each specialist to its owning
department via the departments registry, calls ``prefetch_department``
with the right slug, and threads the result into the specialist's
``analyze(department_memory=...)`` call. Specialists without an owning
department (e.g. ``triage``) must skip the prefetch entirely.
