"""``reset_all_state`` must also wipe the run/audit history tables.

Before this change, the reset endpoint cleared chat/alerts/scheduled-actions
but left ``workflow_runs``, ``audit_log`` and ``eval_runs`` intact. The /jobs
"Runs" tab and /audit page then kept showing the previous fixture's executions
and the demo-page reset looked broken.

This test reaches into the ``_delete_all_rows`` helper that
``reset_all_state`` delegates to, seeds one row in each of the three tables
via their real persistence helpers, and confirms they're empty afterwards.
We invoke ``_delete_all_rows`` directly (not the async ``reset_all_state``)
to avoid pulling ChromaDB, Honcho, and an ``app.state`` shim into a unit
test — the assertion that matters is that the new table names appear in the
wipe tuple and that the deletion actually works against the live schemas.
