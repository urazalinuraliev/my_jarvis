"""Tests for the privacy backstop on the free-text broadcast tools.

Defence-in-depth for the persona's "Choosing Who to Tell" rule: board / comp /
legal-class matters must be DM'd to the scope-holder, never broadcast to a
channel. Curated for precision — legitimate broadcasts (revenue, onboarding,
competitor, compliance) must NOT be blocked.
