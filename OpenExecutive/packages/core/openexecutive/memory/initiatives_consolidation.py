"""One-time consolidation of duplicate initiative rows.

Background: the extraction LLM that populates `initiatives` historically wasn't
shown what already existed, so the same real-world project ("AI Opportunity
Assessment") accumulated as 5-10 near-duplicate rows under variant titles.
This module asks a routing-model pass to cluster the surviving duplicates and
optionally merges each cluster down to a single canonical row.

Designed as a one-off CLI operation, not an ongoing background task: future
duplicates are prevented at write time by the existing-initiatives block
appended to the extraction prompt in `episodic.extract_and_store`.
