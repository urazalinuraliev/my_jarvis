"""The fixed registry of architecture-page sections.

The section IDs must match the SECTIONS const in
packages/ui/src/app/architecture/page.tsx so deep links keep working
and the sidebar renders instantly without waiting for the backend.
Each entry tells the generator three things:

* `kb_query`   – seed query passed to the RAG retriever to fetch
  relevant context chunks for grounding.
* `wants_mermaid` – whether this section should include a diagram.
* `diagram_kind` – `"flowchart"` or `"sequence"`; passed to the prompt
  so Claude picks the right Mermaid dialect.
