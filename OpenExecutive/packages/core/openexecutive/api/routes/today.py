"""GET /today — live dashboard summary for the UI.

Returns a JSON snapshot of:
  • departments — one entry per department with Goal health summary and
    awaiting workflow count
  • people — compact roster with awaiting-action counts and next-SLA time
  • proposals — every unread alert (workflow approvals, triage-classified
    inbound, Executive create_alert calls). The UI splits this into
    "Needs you" vs "Across the team" using caller_person_id plus a
    "principal owns unrouted" rule for alerts with no routed_to_person_id.

The legacy path `/morning-brief` is kept as a deprecated alias for one release
so older UI builds and bookmarked URLs keep working.

GET /today/activity returns the Executive's recent self-initiated activity —
fired scheduled_actions (DMs sent, follow-ups dispatched, cadences run),
plus decisions and advice the system has logged. Powers the "Recent
activity" rail on the briefing-first landing.
