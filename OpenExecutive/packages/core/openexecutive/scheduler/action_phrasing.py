"""Phrase a proposed scheduled action as a concrete, first-person executive action.

The briefing UI renders this string directly after the label "If you
approve:" (see ``packages/ui/src/components/Briefing.tsx``), so the value is a verb
phrase describing what the Executive will *do* on approval — the delivery
(verb + what + to whom + how). It deliberately complements the card's
headline/body (which already carry the *content*) rather than restating them, and
it never reads as a circular "review and approve this action" instruction.

Every argument degrades gracefully: an unknown ``kind`` or ``channel``, or a
missing ``target_name``/``department``, still yields a sensible, non-empty
sentence so a newly-added ``ScheduledAction`` taxonomy can't produce empty UI.
