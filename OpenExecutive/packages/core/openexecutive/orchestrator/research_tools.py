"""Chat tool that drives the executive_research workflow.

The Executive calls ``run_executive_research`` when the principal asks
"what should we be looking into?" or "what's worth knowing right now?".
The tool runs the workflow — which both produces findings AND routes
them (DMs, alerts, watchlist additions, etc. land as side-effects of
the synthesis step) — and returns a structured summary of what was
researched + what was routed. The Executive then describes the run to
the principal in chat.

Mirrors the JSON-in / JSON-out pattern of the other orchestrator tools.
