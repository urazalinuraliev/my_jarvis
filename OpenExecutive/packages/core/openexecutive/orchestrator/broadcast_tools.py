"""Department-scoped and company-wide broadcast tools for the Executive.

Two tools live here:

* ``send_department_message`` — post to a department's configured team
  room on the named integration (slack / discord / telegram). Falls back
  to an error string the model can read and route around when the
  department has no channel configured.
* ``send_company_broadcast`` — post to the integration's
  company-default room. Same error shape on the "not configured" path.

These broadcast tools differ from `send_slack_dm` / `send_discord_dm` /
`send_telegram_message` (in schedule_tools.py) in two ways:

1. They target rooms / channels, not specific people. The People-roster
   gate that protects DMs doesn't apply — channels are team-visible
   surfaces, not private inboxes for individuals who may not have
   consented to being messaged.

2. They are the structural expression of the "Choosing Who to Tell"
   judgment codified in `executive_persona.py` — OE picks among DM /
   dept channel / company broadcast by *which tool it calls*, with
   the persona's section telling it when each is appropriate.

# --- Privacy backstop (defence-in-depth for "Choosing Who to Tell") ----------
# The Executive persona is the PRIMARY control over what may be broadcast. This
# is a deterministic backstop on the free-text broadcast tools: it refuses a
# department/company broadcast whose body mentions a board / compensation /
# legal-class matter, which the privacy invariant says must be DM'd to the
# scope-holder, never posted to a channel. Mirrors the alert dispatcher's
# `_violates_privacy_invariant` (which gates on topic_tags); this works on free
# text, so it is curated for PRECISION (few false positives blocking legitimate
# broadcasts) over recall — and word-boundary matched so "board" doesn't trip on
# "onboarding" or "comp" on "company" (the substring overmatch the dispatcher's
# set explicitly warns about). High-frequency-but-legit words (revenue, legal,
# comp) are deliberately excluded. Add new sensitive vocabulary here.
