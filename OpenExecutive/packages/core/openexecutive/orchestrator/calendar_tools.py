"""Anthropic tool definitions + handlers for calendar booking (first-climb autonomy).

Exposes two tools to the Executive:
- `create_calendar_event` — propose (or auto-execute when promoted) a meeting
- `cancel_calendar_event` — cancel a previously booked event

The handler enforces code-enforced caps regardless of trust-ledger mode, routes
through gate_action for the MEETING_SCHEDULING scope, writes a decision_instances
row so the trust ledger fills, and delegates the actual calendar operation to the
Google Workspace MCP via MCPGateway.call_tool("google_workspace__manage_event").

The approve→execute bridge lives in api/routes/decisions.py.
