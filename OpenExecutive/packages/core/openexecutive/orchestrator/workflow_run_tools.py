"""Anthropic tool definitions + handlers for launching workflows from chat.

Until now the Executive could only fire the five talent workflows
(``start_talent_workflow``) and the research council (``run_executive_research``)
from a chat turn — the other ~25 built-in workflows and every user-created
custom workflow were reachable only through the ``/jobs`` UI. These two tools
close that gap so the principal can ask the Executive to run any workflow
conversationally and get the artifact back in the same turn.

- ``list_workflows`` (read) surfaces the launchable catalog with each
  workflow's input fields, mirroring ``GET /workflows``.
- ``run_workflow`` (write) runs one workflow to completion using the same
  engine as the HTTP route (``openexecutive.api.routes.workflows``) and
  ``start_talent_workflow``: validate inputs, ``create_run``, stream events,
  ``complete_run`` / ``fail_run``. It also handles the approval-gate case — a
  workflow that yields a ``WaitForHumanEvent`` is checkpointed
  (``save_checkpoint``) and reported as ``awaiting_human`` (exactly as the route
  does, ``api/routes/workflows.py``), rather than hanging or erroring.

JSON-in / JSON-out, audited, matching the other orchestrator tools.
