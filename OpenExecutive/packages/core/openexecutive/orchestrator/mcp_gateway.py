# (mcp.client.stdio) does NOT pass our environment through: when
# StdioServerParameters.env is None it gives the child only a fixed safe
# allowlist (HOME, PATH, …) and drops everything else. That silently stripped
# the embedding-cache/offline config, so extensible-mcp's fastembed tool-search
# model (Qdrant/all-MiniLM-L6-v2-onnx, which fastembed resolves from
# "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2") was re-fetched from the Hugging Face
# Hub on every cold start. Forwarding these — set in the API image, see
# docker/Dockerfile — lets fastembed load the baked cache offline instead.
# Only vars actually present are forwarded, so local/CI behaviour is unchanged
# when they are unset (env stays None → SDK default).
#
# The Google* / WORKSPACE_MCP_* / GWORKSPACE_AUTH_MODE vars are forwarded for the

# OWN environment, so the API's Google secrets must reach extensible-mcp here
# first. They carry the workspace-mcp credentials/auth-mode and the credentials
