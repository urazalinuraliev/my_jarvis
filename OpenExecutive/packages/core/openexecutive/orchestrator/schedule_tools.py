"""Anthropic tool definitions + handlers for proactive scheduling and direct channel sends.

These tools are exposed to the Executive alongside `consult_specialist` and the
skill tools. They let the Executive:

- queue a future proactive message via `schedule_followup`
- queue a workflow suggestion (deep-linked nudge) via `suggest_workflow`
- send a Telegram message directly via `send_telegram_message`
- send a Slack DM directly via `send_slack_dm`
- send a Discord DM directly via `send_discord_dm`
- look up a person by name via `lookup_person` (returns routing identifiers)

Email sends already work via the MCP gateway tool `google_workspace__send_gmail_message`,
so there is no `send_email` wrapper here.
