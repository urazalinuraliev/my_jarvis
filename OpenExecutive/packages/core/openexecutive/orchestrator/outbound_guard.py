"""Anti-spam guard for proactive outbound DMs.

Every proactive DM the Executive sends — nudges, principal briefs, executive
reflection, watchlist-research findings, department cadences, and ad-hoc
"DM the CFO about X" actions — funnels through the three send-tool handlers in
``orchestrator.schedule_tools`` (``handle_send_telegram_message`` /
``handle_send_slack_dm`` / ``handle_send_discord_dm``). Those handlers used to do
only a roster gate, so nothing stopped the same person from getting many DMs in
quick succession, near-identical messages repeatedly, or a 3am ping.

``check_outbound_allowed`` is the single chokepoint guard those handlers call
just before the network send. It enforces three controls and, on a violation,
returns a human-readable *reason* string (it never raises) so the caller can
suppress-and-log the send and the Executive can read the reason and adapt
(hold the message, or ``schedule_followup`` for the next open window):

1. Content dedup — refuse a near-identical message already sent to this
   recipient within ``outbound_dedup_window_minutes``.
2. Per-recipient rate cap — refuse once ``outbound_max_per_recipient_per_window``
   sends have gone to this recipient within ``outbound_rate_window_minutes``.
3. Quiet hours / availability — when ``outbound_respect_quiet_hours`` is set,
   refuse while the recipient is on leave or outside their availability windows.

The delivery history is read from the ``status='done'`` ``scheduled_actions``
rows that ``_record_send_to_activity`` already writes for every send, so there
is no new table. The guard is *fail-open*: any internal lookup failure returns
``None`` (allow), because an anti-spam helper must never turn a working send
into a dropped message or a crash.

Scope note: the send handlers are the same tools the Executive uses for both
autonomous proactive DMs and sends a human explicitly asked for, so the guard
applies to both — by design. Suppression is non-destructive: it returns a
reason the Executive reads, so a genuinely-wanted resend can be reworded, or
held / ``schedule_followup``-ed for the recipient's next window. Operators who
want to send identical/off-hours messages can widen the knobs or set
``OUTBOUND_RESPECT_QUIET_HOURS=false``.
