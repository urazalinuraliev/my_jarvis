"""Deterministic engagement-activity gathering for the value report.

Reads what the system actually did for a client over a period — decisions,
initiatives, advice, workflow deliverables, follow-through, monitoring —
straight from one SQLite snapshot. Works identically on the live DB (active
client) and a parked slot's ``state.db`` opened read-only, because both are
the same schema (the whole point of the slot design).

Deliberately SQL-direct with existence-guarded tables (same contract as
``clients/cockpit.py``): the episodic ``list_*`` helpers have no time
filtering and only target the live DB, and a slot saved before a
schema-adding deploy must degrade to empty sections, never error. Everything
here is facts — the LLM only ever narrates this output, it never sources it.
