"""Cross-client cockpit — practice-wide awareness over parked client slots.

The slot architecture's deliberate ceiling is that only the active client is
*live*. The cockpit gives the fractional operator simultaneous awareness
anyway, without touching that ceiling: every parked slot's ``state.db`` is a
complete SQLite snapshot sitting on disk, so we open it **read-only, in
place** and count what matters — overdue follow-ups, awaiting replies,
unread alerts, onboarding tasks coming due. The active client is read from
the live DB instead (its slot copy is only as fresh as the last save-back).

Honesty contract: parked data is as fresh as each slot's ``saved_at``; every
card carries that stamp. One broken slot must never take down the board —
cards degrade individually (``error`` flag) and the rest render.

Engagement metadata (role, status, renewal_date, …) comes from meta.json,
which is practice-level state outside the swap — visible for every client
regardless of which one is active.
