"""The fixed registry of user-guide sections.

The ``/guide`` page is a plain-language overview of every user-facing
feature — "what it is, what it does" — kept separate from the technical
``/architecture`` reference. Like the architecture page, each section is
rendered from a static, version-controlled JSON file under
``guide/prebuilt/<id>.json``; nothing on the serving path calls an LLM.

The section IDs must match the ``GUIDE_SECTIONS`` const in
``packages/ui/src/app/guide/page.tsx`` so deep links keep working and the
sidebar renders instantly without waiting for the backend.
