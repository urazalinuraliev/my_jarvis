"""Discord bot integration for Open Executive.

Mirrors the structure of slack_bot.py. In production the bot is embedded in
the FastAPI lifespan (api/main.py) so it shares the same /data volume as the
API. `run_discord_bot()` / `python -m openexecutive.integrations.discord_bot`
is a standalone dev entry point — useful for iterating on bot-only changes
without restarting the API. Both rely on `create_discord_bot()` returning a
`commands.Bot` whose `.start()` / `.close()` work in any event loop.

Supported interactions:
- DM the bot → Executive replies in DM
- @mention in a guild channel → Executive replies in a thread
- /ask <prompt> slash command → deferred Executive reply
- /today slash command → Today dashboard summary
- post_notification() helper for outbound alerts/digests
