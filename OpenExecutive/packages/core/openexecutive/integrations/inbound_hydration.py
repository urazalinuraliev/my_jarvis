"""Hydrate an inbound DM reply with the context of the outbound DM it answers.

When the Executive ("oe") DMs a rostered person mid-conversation — e.g. the
principal says "DM Alex about the pizza thing" — the send is fire-and-forget
and the recipient's reply otherwise lands in a fresh per-person session with no
history. ``schedule_tools._record_outbound_context`` persists a linkage row at
send time (recipient + outbound text + originating session). This module is the
read side: each DM bot calls :func:`hydrate_user_message` right before handing
the reply to ``Executive.chat`` so oe knows what the person is replying about.

Per the prompt-caching invariant (CLAUDE.md), this context goes in the **user
turn** (prepended to the message text), never the cached system block.
