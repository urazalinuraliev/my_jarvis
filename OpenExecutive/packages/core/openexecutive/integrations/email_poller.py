"""MCP-based Gmail polling loop.

Polls Gmail via the Google Workspace MCP server (OAuth). Each unread message is
passed raw to the Executive, which decides what to do: reply, fetch attachments,
create an alert, or ignore.

Actual tool names (confirmed via tools/list on the live MCP server):
  google_workspace__search_gmail_messages          → plain-text list of Message IDs + Thread IDs
  google_workspace__get_gmail_message_content      → plain-text Subject/From/--- BODY ---/--- ATTACHMENTS ---
  google_workspace__modify_gmail_message_labels    → mark as read (Complete/Extended tier)

No reply logic, no attachment logic, no alert logic lives here — all of that is the
Executive's responsibility via its tool access.
