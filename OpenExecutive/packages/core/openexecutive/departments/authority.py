"""Authority gate for department-scoped proactive actions.

The gate is consulted whenever a proactive action (scheduled or cadence)
has a department slug — it reads the department's authority_level and
decides whether the action should execute immediately, be proposed to an
approver, or be escalated to the principal.

All callers are expected to pass `now` explicitly so the gate is
deterministic and easy to test without time mocking.
