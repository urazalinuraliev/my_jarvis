"""Render current department state into a compact Markdown block for the
5m-TTL system prompt cache slot.

Called by `prompts.cache_manager.build_system_blocks` on every turn. The
result is appended after the company-profile block; the 1h persona and
knowledge blocks are never touched.

Key invariants:
- Output must be deterministic for the same DB state (no timestamps, UUIDs,
  or non-deterministic ordering). Determinism keeps the 5m cache warm.
- Output is capped at _ORG_BLOCK_CHAR_CAP characters so a department with
  many Goals never inflates the system prompt.
- An empty departments table (fresh install, test env) returns "" so no block
  is appended — the function must never raise.
- Phase 3 extended this to include a compact People roster below the
  departments section. The People section is omitted when no People are seeded.

Security note: Goal text fields (key_result, current, target, mission) are
user-controlled strings that land inside the system prompt. All values are
sanitized via _safe() before rendering to prevent prompt-injection via
embedded newlines, Markdown headings, or instruction-like text.
