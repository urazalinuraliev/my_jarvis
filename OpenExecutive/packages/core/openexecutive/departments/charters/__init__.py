"""Seed charter text for the 8 default departments.

Phase 1 fleshes out Finance only; the other 7 ship as two-line stubs that
later phases (and humans editing through the UI) will fill in. Charters are
read once at seed time and persisted into the `departments` table — editing
a charter at runtime goes through the PATCH route, not by editing this file.
