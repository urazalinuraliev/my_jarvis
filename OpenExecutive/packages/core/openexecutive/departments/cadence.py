"""Department cadence scheduler helpers.

A *cadence* is a recurring proactive action tied to a department — e.g.
``"daily@09:00"`` fires a check-in workflow every day at 09:00 UTC.

Phase 5 surfaces two public entry points:

* ``bootstrap_cadences`` — called at startup to ensure every department
  that has a cadence spec already has a pending scheduled_action row.
* ``enqueue_next`` — called by the scheduler after a cadence fires, to
  chain the next occurrence forward.

Cadence specs are stored on the ``DepartmentConfig.cadences`` dict under
the key ``"check_in"``.  Three formats are supported:

* ``"daily@HH:MM"``            — fires every day at HH:MM UTC
* ``"weekly@DOW@HH:MM"``       — fires every week on DOW (3-letter,
  or ``"weekly@DOW-HH:MM"``      e.g. ``thu``) at HH:MM UTC;
                                  either ``@`` or ``-`` may separate DOW from time
* ``"quarterly@DD-HH:MM"``     — fires on day DD of each quarter-start
                                  month (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct) at HH:MM UTC

Anything else is treated as unknown and silently skipped with a warning.
