"""Pydantic models for the Departments feature.

A `Department` is a persistent wrapper around an existing stateless
`BaseAgent` specialist. The wrapper owns charter, Goals, cadences, and an
authority level; the agent itself stays stateless. People-related fields
(`head_person_id`, member ids) are reserved here but not exercised until
Phase 3 lands the People model.
