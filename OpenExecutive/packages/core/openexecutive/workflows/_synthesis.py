"""Shared helpers for workflows that run an Executive tool-use loop.

Both ``executive_reflection`` and ``executive_research`` drive the
Executive through a short tool-use loop with the full outbound toolkit.
The two helpers below are the bits both loops share:

- ``execute_tool_calls`` dispatches any tool_use blocks in a provider
  response against ``_ALL_SKILL_HANDLERS`` and returns one summary per
  call (tool, input_preview, result_preview, ok). Failures are caught +
  summarized so the loop survives a single tool crash.
- ``extract_artifact_from_response`` pulls the concatenated text-block
  content from a provider response — the model's narrative summary
  emitted alongside or after its tool calls.

Promoting these out of ``executive_reflection`` removes the private-
import tripwire ``executive_research`` would otherwise carry — a future
refactor renaming or moving them could silently break the other
workflow.

    """Invoke any tool_use blocks in the LLM response.

    Returns one summary entry per call:
    ``{tool, input_preview, result_preview, ok}``. Failures are caught
    + summarized so a single tool crash does not abort the workflow's
    iteration loop.

    ``budget_remaining`` (optional) caps how many handlers actually
    run. Once budget hits zero, remaining tool_use blocks are NOT
    invoked — their summary entries are still appended with
    ``result_preview = 'over budget — skipped'`` so the model sees a
    tool_result acknowledgement on the next turn. Default ``None``
    leaves the loop unmetered (executive_reflection's behaviour).

    ``free_tools`` (optional) names tools that are exempt from the
    budget — read-only context lookups (e.g. ``lookup_person``) the
    model must call to PREPARE a routing decision. They always execute
    and never decrement ``budget_remaining``, so the Executive can't
    spend its outbound budget on lookups and then have no budget left
    to actually route (the "looks up people but never DMs" failure).
