"""Workflows: deterministic orchestrations of specialists + skills + RAG that
produce a structured executive artifact (board prep deck, quarterly plan,
performance review, etc.).

Workflows differ from chat:
- Inputs are structured (a typed form), not free-form
- Steps are explicit and ordered (the user sees progress)
- The output is a rendered artifact (Markdown), not a conversation turn

Each concrete workflow is a `Workflow` subclass registered in
`WORKFLOW_REGISTRY` below. The HTTP layer is in
`openexecutive.api.routes.workflows`.
