"""Scheduler glue for cadence-enabled dynamic workflows.

A dynamic workflow may carry a cadence string (``daily@HH:MM`` etc.). When it
does, the scheduler should auto-run it and DM the artifact to
``cadence_person_id``. This module owns enqueueing and cancelling those
``scheduled_actions`` rows; the actual run happens in
``scheduler/runner.py``'s ``kind == "dynamic_workflow"`` branch.

Row encoding (mirrors ``departments/cadence.py``):
- ``channel``                = ``"__internal__"`` (never reaches a human directly)
- ``channel_ref``            = the workflow ``name`` (what to run; like dept slug)
- ``assigned_to_person_id``  = ``cadence_person_id`` (who receives the artifact)
- ``kind``                   = ``"dynamic_workflow"``
