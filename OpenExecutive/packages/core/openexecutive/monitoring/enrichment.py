"""Capture-time relevance enrichment for external signals.

Every source — stock move, RSS entry, vendor incident, standing-query hit —
arrives as a raw event with no notion of *why it matters to this company*.
This module scores a freshly-captured Signal against the company profile and
active initiatives and produces a one-line "why this matters", which the
pipeline threads into the alert body (so triage and the principal see it) and
optionally uses to gate low-relevance noise.

Design:

  - Company context is loaded ONCE per scan (``build_company_context``) and
    threaded into each ``enrich_signal`` call — the same two inputs the
    research scheduler's fingerprint reads (profile prompt block + active
    initiatives), so enrichment and research agree on "what the company is".
  - ``enrich_signal`` makes ONE cheap LLM call with NO web_search (it scores
    what was already captured), via the same ``BaseAgent.analyze_with_tools``
    path everything else uses — so an OpenRouter Council override is honoured.
  - Fail-open: any failure returns ``None`` and the caller promotes the signal
    unchanged. Enrichment must never block a real alert.
