"""Scheduler wiring for the periodic watchlist research cron.

PR-D wired the workflow to two triggers (manual chat tool, onboarding
completion). PR-E adds a third: a cron tick that re-runs the workflow
every ``watchlist_research_interval_minutes`` (default 120). The cost
shape of a research run is real — 7 LLM calls × web_search — so each
tick first computes a fingerprint of the inputs the workflow reads
(company profile, active initiatives, existing watchlist slugs) and
SKIPS the run when nothing has changed since the last successful
research. First tick after any meaningful state change runs
immediately; quiet days are free.

That fingerprint only sees *internal* state, so a static profile would
otherwise let the council sit blind to purely-external change (a
competitor move, a regulation shift) indefinitely. A staleness floor
(``watchlist_research_max_staleness_hours``, default 24) bounds that:
once the floor has elapsed since the last successful run, the next tick
runs even when the fingerprint is unchanged. Set the floor <= 0 to
disable it and rely solely on skip-if-unchanged.

Heartbeat lifecycle mirrors ``monitoring.pipeline`` /
``scheduler.nudge_engine``:

  - ``bootstrap_watchlist_research_scan`` — idempotent seed at boot.
  - ``enqueue_next_watchlist_research_scan`` — chain next tick after
    each fire.
  - ``run_watchlist_research_scan`` — one tick. Compute the
    fingerprint, decide skip-or-run, fire workflow, promote artifact
    into an Alert routed to the principal with a date-stable
    dedup_key (so re-fires the same day collapse).

The baseline hash stored on a successful run is recomputed *after* the
workflow finishes, not the pre-run hash used for the skip decision. The
workflow mutates one of its own fingerprint inputs — its watchlist pass
adds rows the fingerprint hashes — so recording the pre-run hash would
leave every subsequent tick seeing a "changed" state and re-running a
full research pass each interval. Capturing the post-run state as the
baseline is what makes "quiet days are free" actually hold.
