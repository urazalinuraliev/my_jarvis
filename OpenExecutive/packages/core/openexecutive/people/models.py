A `Person` is a real human (fractional executive, ops manager, bookkeeper,
board chair, or the founding principal) that the Executive can address,
assign work to, wait on, and resume from in Phase 6.

Phase 3 establishes the model, store, registry, and channel helper.
The WaitForHuman workflow primitive and inbound resolver land in Phase 6.
