"""Redaction helpers for audit-log entries that record tool inputs/outputs.

Tool inputs and outputs can contain secrets (OAuth tokens, auth codes,
session cookies) or PII (raw email bodies, calendar attendees, drive file
contents). Persisting them verbatim into the audit table would turn the
audit log itself into a leak vector. These helpers keep the audit trail
useful — "the Executive called gmail.send" — without copying payloads.
