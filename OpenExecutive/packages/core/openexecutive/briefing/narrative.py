"""Shared Executive-voice briefing narrative.

One synthesizer (`synthesize_briefing_narrative`), two consumers with two
prompts:
  - the **on-page /today header** (`api/routes/today.py`) — a SYNTHESIS that
    does not re-list the cards rendered below it (per-viewer; served from
    `narrative_cache`, regenerated off the request hot path), and
  - the **standalone morning-brief DM** (`workflows/morning_brief.py`,
    `standalone=True`) — an enumerated brief, since the DM has no cards beside
    it.

(The EoD digest has its own separate prompt and does not route through here.)
Sharing the provider call + context rendering keeps both surfaces in the
Executive's voice while letting each use the right structure.
