"""On-disk cache for the on-page briefing narrative.

Mirrors `openexecutive.people.insights_cache`: a dedicated table in the
shared `./episodic_memory.db`, validated against an `input_hash` of the
briefing state. The narrative is one LLM call, so we never generate it on
the request hot path — `/today` serves the cached text instantly and, when
the state hash has moved, regenerates in a FastAPI background task (same
pattern as the per-person insight notes).

Keyed by a `scope` string rather than a person id: the principal and any
unrostered/unresolved viewer share the whole-company narrative under
`"principal"` (the default), while each non-principal teammate gets their own
role-scoped narrative under `person:<id>` (see `today._attach_narrative`).
