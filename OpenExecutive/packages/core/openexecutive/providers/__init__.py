"""LLM provider abstraction.

All Anthropic-shaped LLM calls go through ``get_provider(model)`` rather
than instantiating ``anthropic.AsyncAnthropic`` directly. Today the only
backend is Anthropic itself; the layer exists so a Claude slug can be
routed via OpenRouter (and non-Claude OpenRouter slugs can be selected
per-agent) without rewriting every call site's Anthropic-shaped request.
